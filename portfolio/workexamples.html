                <p>This project is a database that I created for a music lesson 
                    studio organization. There are multiple studios, teachers and students interacting 
                    here and my database is designed to manage all of the necessary information.

                    in this diagram are entities, their relationships and attributes. Important details are noted
                    such as the number of entities involved in a relationship and primary keys. Assumptions are also
                    noted at the bottom to avoid any possible confusion in the design.

                <p>This is a user interface I created in a team project with two other classmates.
                The purpose of this application is to allow a user to add and delete computer images. A user must also be able to add and 
                delete applications which can then be added to a selected computer image.</p>

                <div class="sectionhead">Math Game</div>
                <p>I created this game to help my daughter study for her weekly tests 
                over multiplication facts. In the tests she was required to answer twenty random questions correctly under one minute. 
                This game is my attempt to make studying for her tests fun!</p>

                <div class="sectionhead">How It Works</div>
                <p>The Math Jungle lets players select a multiple to practice, then a time limit. They 
                attempt to answer twenty questions correctly, collecting gems and improving on their stats along the way. After 
                the player has answered twenty multiplication questions or time has expired, statistics are displayed in the 
                left of the panel. Scrolling down in that area allows them to review their answers from the previous round.</p>
