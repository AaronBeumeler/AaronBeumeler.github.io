            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The task here was to reproduce the webpage shown in this image. 
            The only content provided in this project's description were the image files to be included in the page 
            and the image of the page itself. Click on the example image to the left to see the reproduction created
            from scratch.</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is a user interface I created in a team project with two other classmates.
            The purpose of this application is to allow a user to add and delete computer images. A user must also be able to add and 
            delete applications which can then be added to a selected computer image.</p>

                <div class="sectionhead">Math Game</div>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I created this game to help my daughter study for her weekly tests 
                over multiplication facts. In the tests she was required to answer twenty random questions correctly under one minute. 
                This game is my attempt to make studying for her tests fun!</p>

                <div class="sectionhead">How It Works</div>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Math Jungle lets players select a multiple to practice, then a time limit. They 
                attempt to answer twenty questions correctly, collecting gems and improving on their stats along the way. After 
                the player has answered twenty multiplication questions or time has expired, statistics are displayed in the 
                left of the panel. Scrolling down in that area allows them to review their answers from the previous round.</p>
