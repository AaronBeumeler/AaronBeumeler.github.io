      <p id="p1">The most important goal of effective communication is clarity.
          Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message
          is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship
          that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>

      <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization
          and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data,
          as simplification usually does.</p>

      <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than 
         attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the 
         "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
      
      <h2 style="color: blue;">Questions</h2>
      <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly
          using HTML.</p>
      <p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Explain the difference between the 
         "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</p>
      <p>The "alt" attribute is shown in the place of an image that cannot be displayed while the 
         "title" attribute is often shown as a tool tip while the image is being displayed. They are 
         different and can be used separately or together.</p>

      <p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Please provide an example of how to mark up
         a definition from the dictionary below.</p>
      <p><b>dic&#8729tion&#8729ar&#8729y</b>
         <br>
            &#8725'dikSH&#601 ner&#275&#8725
         <br>
         <i>noun, plural </i><b>dic&#8729tion&#8729ar&#8729ies</b>
         <div class="def">a book or electronic resource that lists the words of a language (typically
            in alphabetical order) and gives their meaning, or gives the equivalent words in a 
            different language, often also providing information about pronunciation, origin, 
            and usage.
            <p class="alert">"I'll look up "love" in the dictionary."</p>
         </div>
         </p>
      <p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Provide an example of a link pointing to your 
         favorite site.</p>
      <p>One of my favorte sites is 
         <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a>. It is a great place to learn a variety of 
            programming languages. The site is also handy when you get stumped while trying to write code.</p>
